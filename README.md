# Personal Porfolio Site

## What it contains....

This site contains most of my personal projects and clients projects I have worked on.
I can't post them all here because not all clients want their projects outside.
It also contains some brief info about me. Who I am, my interests, skills etc. I have included my resume,
its,content is on the site, but I have added its as a file too just iin case you want to download.

I started my journey into the world of tech when I was a kid, as a graphic designer with a lot of interest 
in software development. I gradually progressed into UI/UX Design and then later ventured into wen development.
I still wanted more so continue to pursue Desktop and Mobile app development. I tried varies options in the
mobile and desktop app development and found what suited my interest and was flexible and easy to work with
I also love games to I pursued game development too. This might seem wild, irresponsible and indecisive, but
trust me, this made me love technology more. I am a fast learner and love what I do. I believe this is enough to
get me going.
